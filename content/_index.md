I graduated from the University of Advancing Technology (UAT) in December 2021 with a degree in Computer Science focusing on software development. During my time at UAT, I was able to increase my knowledge as a programmer and explore other areas of Computer Science.

During my free time, I enjoy creating projects on my own and seeing what I build come to life. One of my favorite projects that I made was a console game in C++ that mimicked a Dungeons and Dragons style game called Dungeon Crawler. As it was one of my more in-depth projects with a couple thousand lines of code.

When I'm not programming, I enjoy cooking, going to the gym, and learning more about the Linux environment. Before going to UAT, I volunteered to teach karate as a first degree black belt which I enjoyed. Additionally, my interest in teaching gave me my first job where I taught programming and computer science to children.
